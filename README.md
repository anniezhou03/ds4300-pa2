# ds4300-pa2

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a RAG system that allows students to ask queries and interact with the course notes. This can be achieved using different variables such as text chunking, vector databases, embedding models, and LLMs. Through different combinations of these variables, students can analyze efficiency and accuracy to get an optimal combination.
